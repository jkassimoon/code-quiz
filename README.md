* ## Project Description

For this project, we created a quiz that tests the user on their JavaScript knowledge. When the user clicks "Start the Quiz", the first question pops up with 2 multiple choice answer buttons. If the user answers the question correctly, it moves on to the next question; if the user answers the question incorrectly, it deducts 1 second from the timer and deducts 10pts from the score. The test will not move on to the next question until the correct answer is selected, unless the timer times out. Once the user either finishes the quiz by answering all the questions or by timing out, the user can input their name into a high scores list.

* ## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this project.

* ## Challenges

I had a tough time working with the last portion of the quiz: dynamically generating an input section and submit button, then having that user name and score stored into an array, then learning how to sort it in an descending order. I still struggle a lot with scope so this required a lot of reviews on my part.
